Sample repository for GitHub tutorial.

Hey guys!  This is my first experience with GitHub and I am currently learning how to edit branches and (eventually) how to merge those commits to the master.  I am fairly familiar with C++, HTML5 and CSS (and on the verge of learning the responsive bootstrap framework as well as JavaScript).  Happy coding!
